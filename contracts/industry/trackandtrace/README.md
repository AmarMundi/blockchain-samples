# Track and Trace Contract Sample

This is a small and very simple track and trace application to follow surgical kits from creation through their use in a hospital or clinic. 

This contract is based upon the [IoT Contract Platform](http://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/blockchain-samples/contracts/platform/iotcontractplatform), and is meant to demonstrate some of the features that the platform provides with little to no effort.
